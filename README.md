# Emergency_receiver
Built a companion app for emergency contacts to monitor real-time SOS alerts. When someone sends an SOS message, the contact can view the senderâ€™s exact location, distance to the sender, and the shortest path marked using OSRM + OSMDroid (100% open-source). The app also shows driver details once a responder accepts the SOS request. (No API costs)
